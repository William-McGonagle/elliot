## How to Use
Elliot is a very simple to use system. First, type the data that you want to send in the top text-area. Then, type the IP address into the input that says 'ip'. After that, do the same thing, except for the 'port' input. Next, set the protocol by choosing either UDP or TCP. Finally, to send out the request, click the 'run button'.
